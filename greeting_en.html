                                        Thank you very much for your continued support and the great contributions you
                                        have made to medical practice, medical research, education, and training through
                                        your products.
                                    </p>

                                        We will be holding the "Nagasaki City's Newest Exhibition" at the Nagasaki
                                        International Exhibition Hall (Dejima Messe Nagasaki) from Saturday, October 7,
                                        to Sunday, October 8, 2023.

                                        We are pleased to announce that the 51st Annual Meeting of the Japanese Dental
                                        Society of Anesthesiology and the 14th Annual Meeting of the Federation of Asian
                                        Dental Anesthesia Society (FADAS) will be held concurrently.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Japanese Dental Society of Anesthesiology will celebrate the 50th
                                        anniversary of its establishment in 2022. The society aims to fulfill the needs
                                        and expectations of the public in the next half a century. We take our
                                        responsibility of nurturing specialists who can assist in the safe, secure,
                                        trusted, and comfortable delivery of dental care to patients seriously. In
                                        today's multidisciplinary healthcare environment, dental anesthesiologists must
                                        collaborate with fellow medical colleagues and other health staff members. To
                                        achieve our purposes, we need to prioritize and ensure medical safety and
                                        quality assurance. We must also develop the next generation of advanced medical
                                        care. Furthermore, we must take on bold challenges by promoting relevant
                                        clinical research, medical-industrial collaborations, and AI applications.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For the first time, the annual meeting of the FADAS will be held in Nagasaki.
                                        Historically, Nagasaki held close cultural ties with China, Taiwan, and
                                        Southeast Asia. More recently, the city has continued to build close economic
                                        ties with these countries. As we are overcoming the coronavirus pandemic, it is
                                        a timely opportunity to invite overseas clinicians and researchers who share the
                                        same aspirations to present and discuss the latest medical research and ideas.
                                        This will also provide a valuable opportunity to discuss how we can promote
                                        future international collaborations, and convey
                                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">"empathy and trust"</span>
                                        to all
                                        patients, and medical and other healthcare professionals worldwide.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        With the operation of the new Shinkansen bullet train line in 2022, a new
                                        chapter will begin for Nagasaki. As the first city to introduce Western medicine
                                        to Japan, it seems most appropriate that we meet in Nagasaki to discuss the
                                        future direction of dental anesthesiology. It will be most exciting to meet
                                        together physically after a long time. To meet the expectations of our members,
                                        we are working together with members of the Scientific Meeting Organizing
                                        Committee to ensure that the meeting is creative and innovative. The spread of
                                        the new coronavirus infection, partly due to the effects of mutant strains,
                                        continues to impact societies and economies around the world. The Tokyo Summer
                                        Olympics and Paralympics in 2020 and the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics
                                        in 2021 were successfully held without any spectators, and left a great
                                        impression in the memory of many due to the efforts of all concerned. These
                                        events also highlighted the importance and value of meeting face-to-face, and
                                        the exhilarating feeling that comes with physical interactions.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Japanese Dental Society of Anesthesiology also confirmed, based on the
                                        experience of holding the meeting online for two years, that it is possible to
                                        effectively exchange academic opinions via the Internet. The advantages of
                                        virtual meetings are that many participants can come together to attend various
                                        committees and meetings without traveling, and therefore, are cost-effective and
                                        time-saving. Importantly, we have learned how efficient on-demand presentations
                                        are for medical and healthcare professionals who wish to study the latest
                                        medical knowledge and techniques but are unable to meet at a specific time and
                                        place due to other commitments such as parenting responsibilities. Virtual
                                        meetings are also helpful to young researchers who may not have exuberant funds
                                        to spend on travel and accommodation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We are looking forward to the 2023 Annual Meeting. It will be the first time the
                                        meeting is held in Nagasaki in the last 25 years. We are excited that we can
                                        meet face-to-face and interact as much as we want, after a long absence.
                                        We hope that you will attend this meeting and take home with you the latest
                                        medical knowledge and techniques, as well as enjoy the energetic atmosphere. It
                                        will be a great meeting that affirms the responsibility and pride of dental
                                        anesthesiologists who will lead the next generation.
